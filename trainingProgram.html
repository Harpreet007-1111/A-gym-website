  <h1>BEGINNER STRENGHT AND MUSCLE WEIGHT TRAINING PROGRAM.</h1>
  <H3>BY <U>PAUL ROGER</U> | REVIEWED BY HEATHER BLACK | UPDATED ON APRIL 16, 2021</H3>

  <p>This is one ina series of regular wieght training programs. Each program is optimized for a specific outcome including general fitness, weight loss, body shaping, and sport-specific programs.</p>

  <p>This strenght and musle program is not just for begginers. You should use it if you want a formalized and precise program following casual experince with weights. As the name implies, it's an all-round program for basic strenght and Musle building. This could be used in off-season training if your sport has elements of strenght, power and muscular endurance, which fits many sports. Consult your coach to ensure it doesn't conflict with other training priorities. Training programs are always efficient when tailored specifically for individuals and thier goals.</p>

  <p>it's worth reading the introductory weight training information before starting this program, or any program for the matter. The exercise uses the standard free weight and equipment found in the gyms. All exercises can be done at home if you have the <u>appropriate home gym equiupments</u>. A medical examination and clearance is wise if you've been sedentary for a lenghty period. Take care with injured or dysfunctional joints. Get medical advice before starting weight training if this applies to you.</p>

  <p>The basic Program includes: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Warm-up</li>
    <li>Squat (or leg press)</li>
    <li>Bench Press (or chest press)</li>
    <li>Deadlift</li>
    <li>Crunch</li>
    <li>Seated Cable row</li>
    <li>Triceps pushdown</li>
    <li>Lat Pulldown</li>
    <li>Overhead press</li>
    <li>Biceps curl</li>
    <li>Cool-down, stretch</li>
  </ol>
   
  <h2 id="warm-up">The Warm-up</h2>
  <p>Warm uo with 10 minutes of aerobic exercise. This can be with treadmill walking or jogging, stationary bicycle, cross-trainer, or stepper machines. Extend this to 30 minutes depending on reqiurements of fat loss. Weight trainers should do at least 30 minutes of <a href="https://www.verywellfit.com/cardio-and-weight-training-and-fat-loss-3498325">cadio</a>  exercise at moderate intensity three weeks each week to promote aerobic fitness. It needs not to be done at the same time as the weights session.</p>
  <p>Warm-uos are important to get blood flowing to the heart, lungs, muscles and lubricating fuid loosening the joints ready for action. Each weights execrise should include a warm-up with light weight you will be using for your workout is about right for ;8warm-ups. Streching is not so important before excersice and is better performed after execrise. Some light stretches will do no harm.</p>
    
  
  <h2 id="execrise">The Execrise</h2>
  <p>If you have little experince with weight training abd free weights, you may wish to start with the machine leg press instead of the squats, especially if you are not accompanied by a trainer, helper, or spotter. Even so, there is no reson to be intemidated by the squat execrise. It nedd not to be done ina squat rack or power cage with with the big bar and free weights to begin  with, although squatting with the bar alone is a good way to practice form. Dumbbells or small-bars barbells or a smith machine can provide reassurance for the beginner. The same applies to the racked bench press with heavy bar, which can be subsituted with dumbbells or lighter barbells. The keys is not to lift too heavy too soon.</p>

    <h2 id="sets">SETS, REPETITIONS, AND STARTING WEIGHTS</h2>

    <P>You will start with 1 set of 12 repetitions for each of 9 execrise for the first week. At workout session 8, you should have progressed to 3 sets of 12 repetitions for each execrise. The wieght you choose to start with will be sufficient to perform a set of 12 repetitions to failure with good form, which means that the 12th repetition is the pretty much the most you can do without having to rest. This is called 12RM(repetition maximum)</p>
  
  <p>Various formulas exist for calculating what this starting weight should be, but trail and error works too. If you're new to free weights, this helps with familiarization as well. Try an obvios light weight to warm up and then upgrade to something heavier for the workout set. By the third set, you should have settled on the 12RM wieght. If not, just move on and upgrade the weigth next session.</p>

  <p>The rest perid between sets is variable according too your goals. For strenght rather than muscle size(hypertrophy), and elements of muscle endurance, shorter rest usually works best-around 45 to 90 seconds. Considering that this program is designed for a combination of strenght and muscle building, you will rest for one minute is fine if possible. Longer interval than one minute is fine if that's what you require to continue.</p>

  <p>When you see something like <i>Squat: 150x3x12, 60 seconds</i>, it means 150 pounds(or kiograms depending on the source) for 3 sets of 12 repetitions with 60 seconds rest in between sets.</p>

      <h2 id="frequency-of-workout">FREQUENCY OF WORKOUT</h2>
      <P>This program is designed for 3 workout sessions each week for 6 weeks. If you consider that 3 workouts is too much because of time or fitness constraints, try to do at least 2 sessions per week. In either case, the sequence of progression is as follows:

        This program is based around 18 sessions comprised of either 6 weeks of 3 sessions or 9 weeks of 2 sessions for 9 exercises.
        
        Here’s how it works (sets X repetitions, seconds break, for each exercise):</P>

        <ul>
          <li>session 1 - 1X12, 60 seconds</li>
          <li>session 2 - 1X12, 60 seconds</li>
          <li>session 3 - 1X12, 60 seconds</li>
          <li>session 4 - 2X12, 60 seconds</li>
          <li>session 5 - 2X12, 60 seconds</li>
          <li>session 6 - 2X12, 60 seconds</li>
          <li>session 7 - 2X12, 60 seconds</li>
          <li>session 8-18 - 3X12, 60 seconds</li>
        </ul>

        <p>After sessions 12, consider whether you need to increase the weigth for any particular exercise. If you can comfortably do more than the RM of 12 exercise, increase the weight bya modest amount, say two pounds or a kilogram for the isolation exercise muscles such as triceps and biseps, and 5 pounds or 2.5Kg for comppund and large muscles group excercises like squats and deadlifts. When using dumbbells, this wouls apply to each one. Don't increase the nimber of the sets beyond 3 at this time.</p>

        <p>Note the flexibility here. If you're an experinced casual lifter starting an organized program, you may be able to kick off with 3X12 from the beginning. If you are new to weights and have some fitness issues, you should start with one set and progress slowly. Doing only 1 set of 9 excercises will not take too long, perhaps only 30 minutes with warm-up included. Doing an extra 20 minutes or more of the cadio before or after weights would be time well spent at this stage. Once you reach full stretch in the program, <a href="#">aerobic training may be better done before weights</a> or at a separate session.</p>

  <h2 id="order-of-excersise" >ORDER OF EXERCISES</h2>
  <P>The exercise order should be maintained as above, busy gyms notwithstanding. This order has been designed with large muscle group compound exercises first, the smaller muscle isolation exercises following, and with alternating "push" and "pull" to achieve a session that alternates muscle groups and modes of action as much as possible to enable maximum rest and recovery of the various muscle groups. Some compromises were required. Don’t get too hung up if you can’t achieve this sequence. It’s not always possible to access equipment when you want it in gyms. In the scheme of things, it’s not fatal.

    Here are some examples of compound, isolation, and push and pull exercises.</P>  
    <ul>
      <li>Squats - compound - push</li>
      <li>Seated cable row - compound - pull</li>
      <li>Triceps pushdown - isolation - push</li>
      <li>Overhead press - compound - push</li>
      <li>Biceps curl - isolation - pull</li>
    </ul>
